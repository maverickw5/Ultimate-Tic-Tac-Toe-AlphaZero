### Ultimate Tic Tac Toe using the AlphaZero algorithm

## About the project

![UTTT screenshot][uttt_screenshot]

This is my senior project made by me and my teammates as computer science students in National Taipei University. In this project, our target is to research how classical games are mastered by the Alphazero program and to do so, we have chosen Ultimate Tic Tac Toe as a medium-to-hard level game to be our main subject.

Introduction to Alphazero:
AlphaZero is a computer program developed by artificial intelligence research company DeepMind to master the games of chess, shogi and go. Known for beating the world-champion program in each case, Alphazero learns everything from zero through pure self play. The concept of Alphazero is replacing hand-crafted rules with a deep neural network and general purpose algorithms that know nothing about the game beyond the basic rules.

Note: If smaller grids that result in a tie, here we count it as neither X nor O
